# Push_swap
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

# How to run
You can compile whole project with
```
make
```
Or you can open project with CLion and load CMake Project

# Marks
```
4/5 (less than 750 operations) - 100 numbers 
3/5 (less than 7500 operations) - 500 numbers
```

# Bonus
```
-v -- vizualization flag
-c -- vizualization with colors
```

# Python generator
Tester generates sequence of numbers and run push_swap and checker
How to use:

```./test.py start_number end_number count_of_tests [flags of your checker]```

or

```python3 test.py start_number end_number count_of_tests [flags of your checker]```
